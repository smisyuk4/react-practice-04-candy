      <h2>Bulk Unwrapped Candy</h2>
      <p>
        Bulk unwrapped candy makes building a candy buffet a piece of cake. Just
        pour the gummies, Skittles, or jelly beans straight into the candy
        dishes and simply provide a scoop for your guests to use. Having
        unwrapped candy in bulk allows the guests to gather as much candy as
        they want without having a mess of candy wrappers to clean up after the
        event ends. Color coordinating is easier than ever, as well. Almost
        every type of candy is available in nearly all of the colors of the
        rainbow. Your themed event will be a hit with color matching candy and
        sweet. Shop the selection today at Candy Warehouse!
